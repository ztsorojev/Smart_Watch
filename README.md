## How it works

Click on the mic icon and start speaking. Your voice will be transcripted in the screen of the watch.

If there is a mistake, click on the button "Modify". This will select the last word of the text in the screen. Each time you click on "Modify", it selects the word just before. This way, you can go through every word, selecting them one by one.

Once you have selected the word you want to edit, simply speak the new word(s) to update it. Once you are fine with that, press "Modify" again to exit the edit state, and you can then continue speaking the rest of your sentence.
